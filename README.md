# FinalProject
Schedule Maker
To run our code simply execute scheduleTestV4.cpp (I ran it in vsCode)
scheduleTestV4.cpp should display textual prompts to the user to answer about their courses.
It will then output a text file with the available schedules into the folder where scheduleTestV4.cpp is located.
If this file is blank after running scheduleTestV4.cpp, then it means that no viable schedules were found.
Make sure that scheduleVisualizerV2.py is in the same folder as scheduleTestV4.cpp and the outputted text file.
Run scheduleVisualizerV2.py (I ran it in vsCode)
It should produce a helpful graph depicting your schedule.
